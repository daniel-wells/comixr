Analysis of digi-pico sequencing of Ovarian Cancers

The data is from Ahmed Ahmed's lab in the WIMM, Oxford, and this analysis is supervised by Chris Yau (Department of Statistics / WTCHG, Oxford).

The aim of the project is to develop a visalisation of somatic copy number abberations from near single cell sequencing (10-20 cells) of chemotherapy resistant ovarian tumours.
